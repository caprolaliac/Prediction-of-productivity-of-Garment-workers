# Prediction of productivity of Garment workers
 Prediction of productivity of Garment workers using various regression models in python and deploying it as a web app locally using flask

The goal of this project is to predict  productivity in a garment manufacturing environment. In order to maximise operational effectiveness and resource utilisation, targeted productivity is absolutely essential. Businesses may make educated decisions, improve planning, and increase performance by precisely projecting productivity levels.
In order to estimate targeted productivity based on different input features including work in progress (WIP), overtime, and other important factors, our research intends to construct a predictive model utilising machine learning techniques. Production managers may use the model in real-time to help them proactively spot bottlenecks, allocate resources wisely, and streamline workflow.
In this project, we'll examine the dataset, highlight significant correlations between variables, train and test various regression models, and choose the top model for deployment. This project has a great deal of promise to promote operational excellence, improve decision-making, and ultimately help industrial organisations succeed.
